Q6. createRoot in React

Select the most appropriate option after looking at the following code.

Options
This problem has only one correct answer

The code is correct, and the heading will be displayed.
The id attribute's value must always be set as root, which is a default value in react, to display the heading.
The id attribute’s value can be anything, but the same should be passed to getElementById in the createRoot function to display the heading.
We must use JSX to display the heading.

Ans. The id attribute’s value can be anything, but the same should be passed to getElementById in the createRoot function to display the heading.

Solution Description
The createRoot method expects to receive an HTML node as the first argument. The getElementById method is searching for a node with an id of “root” which does not match the id of the div. So it will fail to render the JSX.
